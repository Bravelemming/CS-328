AJAX

basic idea, still make a request but the response is less than a full page or document, and client side javascript uses that response to modify the current page, instead of replacing the whole page.

the client web browser creates a javascript objecct called XMLHttpRequest

this XMLHttpRequest object makes the request from an application web server

the data is sent back by application web server, coould be in JS, XML, or JSON,

once it arrives at client browser, javascript code appropriately injects it into the current displayh page.

ajax is not a programming language or product you need to install.  its built in to the web browser.  built on open standards.  must have javascript enabled.

/* in javascript , in a onscreen control elements event handler
*/

var ajaxReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
ajaxReq.open("GET", "desired_url", false);
ajaxReq.send(null);

//because of the false in open methods third argument,
//the next line is not reached until the web request
//has been completed and the response recieved.

{
	//make a new XMLHttpRequest object
	var ajaxReq = new XMLHttpRequest();

	ajaxReq.send(null);

	//when request is completed, you'll reach this

	var outputTextArea = document.getElementById("output");
	outputTextArea.value = ajaxReq.responseText;

	// .responseText is the return of ajaxReq
