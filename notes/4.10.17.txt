javascript in the book

client side javascript
----------------------

javascript is actually an implementation of a web standard called ECMAScript 6

ecmascript spec does not describe the document object model

the DOM defines the way in which HTML document objects
are exposed to your javascript

you can embed client side JS within HTMl, within a php doc, or as an external files with the suffix .js

to be seperate; try to limit JS to within the head element inside a hTML or PHP doc

<script src="desired_file_or_URL.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>

when you put the JS inside the script tags, you don't need a SRC

-------
how do browsers load documents?
fetch requested document (executed clientside)
if it encounters a scripted element offsite, it pulls it and downloads and executes the script, stopping the parse on the HTML document
the concern is that your website stops loading while you load jS.  this is a problem if you are including large JS libraries.

HTML5 attributes for the script element to continue parallel downloading and HTML loading
<script async="async">  === script can be downloaded at the same time as parsing AND other script downloads (no script dependencies) 
<script defer="defer"> === execute scripts in order of appearance, most likely because there are dependencies.
this does not block the browser from merrily parsing HTML
while downloading the scripts


-----------------

// dont need script tags in an external .js

function sayMagicWord()
{
	var nameField = document.getElementById("enteredName");

	if (nameField.value === "")
	{
		alert("PLEASE to unknown person");
	}
	else
	{
		alert("please!" + nameField.value);
	}s
	
}
