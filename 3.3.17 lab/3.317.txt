

PHP

variables start with a $ 



= is assignment

== is comparison where we don't care about the type

=== is comparison when we do care about the type

!= comparison for not equal where we don't care about the type

!== comparison for not equal where we care about the type

boolean: TRUE FALSE

if (expression) {
	
}
elseif (expression) {
	
}
else
 expression;


fuunctions!
keyword function-name ($parameter-name){}

function function-name ($param_name, $param_name){
	statements;
	return;	
}


INtERACTING WIth FORMS:
-----------------------------------------

<form method = "post" action = "www........../welcome.php">



<input type = "submit" />
</form>



php supports 4 scallar types;
integer float string boolean

two non scalar types;
arrays and objects

php has very flexible arrays

php also provies a number of superglobal associative arrays
their names are all uppercase and have an underscore after dollar sign

$_POST == superglobal array

$_POST will contain the name = value pairs from a submimtted form whose method ="post"

you can access a given value for a name with $_POST["thatname"]

$_GET will contain name=value pairs for method="get"


php provides functions that fight bad stuff from the user like cross site scripting


strip_tags : expects a string, returns that string with all angel bracket tags removed
<p> Welcome 
<?= strip_tags($_POST["name"]) ?> 
, how are you?
</p>

htmlspecialchars : expects a string and returns string with html special characters encoded (&lt;)

<?= strip_tags($_POST["name"]) ?> 

-----------------------


connecting to oracle form php
(from nrs-projects to the hsu oracle student database)

need to set up a connection string
try to log into database

set up a sql pl/sql to be executed

execute it

obtain loop the results

close the statement

close the connection

$db_conn_str = "DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (pROTOCOL = TCP)"."
"(hOST = cedar.humboldt.edu)".
"(PORT = 1521))".
"(CONNECT_DATA = (SID = STUDENT)))";

php has many dB packages!  we are using one called OCI
oracle call interface


$conn = oci_connect($username, $password, $db_conn_str);

if ($conn == FALSE){
	//complain and quit
}

$empl_query = "select hiredate, salary, commission ".
				"from empl";

$stmt = oci_parse($conn, $empl_query);

oci_execute($stmt, OCI_DEFAULT);

//loop through results

while (oci_fetch($stmt))
{
	oci_result($stmt, "empl_last_name");
}

oci_free_statement($stmt);
oci_close($conn);
