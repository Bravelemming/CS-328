fieldset element - block element, can be nested in a form.

used to  logically group elements together such as logically related form controls

by default changable using  css, displays with a thin solid border
around the contained elements.  

fieldset can contain a legend element whose content is by default
text displayed within that fieldsets border

if you set a value attribute for a textfield its value will be the initial content of that textfield

placeholder attribute's value will appear in the box, in a lighter grey and will disappear when the user types, but reappear if they delete - nice alternative for instructions
